# A 22tracks plugin for Logitech SqueezeBox media server #

This is a Logitech Media Server (LMS) (a.k.a Squeezebox server) plugin to play
tracks from 22tracks. To install, use the settings page of Logitech Media server.
Go to the _Plugins_ tab, scroll down to _Third party source_ and select _22tracks_.
Press the _Apply_ button and restart LMS.

The plugin is included as a default third party resource. It is distributed via my
[personal repository](http://server.vijge.net/squeezebox/) There is no need
to add an additional repository, because this is an official third party repository.
However, if you want to, you can add the repository directly. A new version might be
earlier available in this repository:
