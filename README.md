# A 22tracks plugin for Logitech SqueezeBox media server #

This is the old Logitech Media Server (LMS) (a.k.a Squeezebox server) plugin to play
tracks from 22tracks. It was working when 22tracks still streamed tracks from its own
web site. Now 22tracks switched to Spotify streams, which can already be played by
Squeezeboxes.

This code is left here because it is a nice example of a plugin that fetches data using
JSON requests, and plays files from a remote server.
